Q-1. Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').

ans:
    Files can be opened in different modes depending on the operation you want to perform.

    1. 'r' Mode :-
        -> Open file in reading mode.
        -> You can only read data into the file.
    
    2. 'w' Mode :-
        -> Open file in Write mode.
        -> You can only write data into the file.
        -> If file exists, it will be truncated(overwritten).
        -> If file not exists, it will be created.

    3. 'a' Mode :-
        -> Open file in Write mode.
        -> If file exists, new data will be appended to the end of the file.
        -> If file not exists, it will be created.
        -> You can only write data to the file.

    4. 'r+' Mode :-
        -> Open file in both reading and writing.
        -> Raises an error if the file does not exist.

    5. 'w+' Mode :-
        -> Open file in both reading and writing.
        -> If file exists, it will be truncated.
        -> If file not exist, it will created.
