Q-2. Understanding multiple exceptions and custom exceptions.

ans:
    1. Multiple Exceptions :- 
        Python allows you to handle multiple types of exceptions within a single try-except block.
        This enhances code readability.

    2. Custom Exceptions :-
        You can create your own exceptions by creating custom exception classes. This improves code 
        clarity and provides more informative error messages.
