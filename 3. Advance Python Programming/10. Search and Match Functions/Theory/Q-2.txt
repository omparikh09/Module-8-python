Q-2. Difference between search and match.

ans:
    1. re.match() :-
        -> Checks for the match only at the start of the string.
        -> Only beginning of the string.
        -> Match object if pattern is at start.

    2. re.search() :-
        -> Search for a match anywhere in the string.
        -> anywhere in the string.
        -> Match object if pattern is found anywhere.
